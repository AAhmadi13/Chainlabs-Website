        <div class="title">Benefits of Blockchain Technology</div>
        <br />
        <h2>Security</h2>
        <p>
          Blockchain offers reliable security through ‘Cryptography’ and
          ‘Decentralisation’ processes. One data is recorded onto a blockchain
          which is nearly impossible to customise or erase; this makes it very
          reliant and resistant to fraud and unauthorised access.
        </p>
        <br />

        <h2>Cost Efficiency</h2>
        <p>
          By eliminating intermediaries and automating processes through smart
          contracts, blockchain can reduce transaction costs and streamline
          operations. This is particularly beneficial in sectors like finance
          and supply chain management.
        </p>
        <br />

        <h2>Decentralisation</h2>
        <p>
          There is no one authority or weak spot in the realm of blockchain
          technology since it can only operate on distributed networks of
          computers. Increasing trust and strength via decentralisation makes it
          more difficult for unauthorised access or system breakdowns to occur.
        </p>
        <br />

        <h1>Disadvantages of Blockchain Technology</h1>
        <br />

        <h2>Energy Consumption</h2>
        <p>
          Some blockchain systems, like Bitcoin, use a lot of energy for things
          like mining and processing transactions. This has raised questions
          about whether it's bad for the environment. That's what some
          blockchain networks are like. They're using tons of energy, and that's
          not great for the planet. It's not just the energy, it's also the
          pollution it causes. This is a big problem, especially now that we're
          all trying to be more eco-friendly.
        </p>
        <br />

        <h2>Lack of Regulation</h2>
        <p>
          The clear lack of regulations in terms of jurisdictions can end up in
          legal and complaint issues for blockchain projects. This possibility
          can significantly decrease the investment in blockchain technology.
        </p>
        <br />

        <h2>Complexity</h2>
        <p>
          Blockchain technology is like a digital ledger that keeps a secure
          record of transactions. Imagine it as a shared digital notebook where
          you can write down who sent what to whom. This notebook is not stored
          in one place; it's duplicated across many computers, making it hard to
          tamper with.<br />
          <br />To set up and use this digital notebook, you need some technical
          skills, like knowing how to write in a special code. Also, you need a
          bunch of computers working together, which can be costly.<br />
          <br />For regular people and organisations, It's powerful but not
          always necessary for everyday tasks. So, it's important to think
          carefully before diving into blockchain technology, as it can be a bit
          like using a sledgehammer to crack a nut in some situations.
        </p>
        <br />

        <h1>How are Blockchains Used?</h1>

        <p>
          Blocks on the blockchain of Bitcoin, as we now know, store
          transactional data. On a blockchain today, there are over 23,000
          alternative cryptocurrency systems. However, it turns out that
          preserving information about other kinds of transactions on blockchain
          is dependable.<br /><br />

          Among the businesses exploring with blockchain include Siemens,
          Walmart, Pfizer, AIG, and Unilever. For instance, IBM developed the
          Food Trust blockchain to track the path taken by food goods as they
          are delivered to their destinations.<br /><br />

          Why do this action? Numerous E. Coli, salmonella, and listeria
          outbreaks have occurred in the food sector; in certain instances,
          dangerous substances were inadvertently added to food. It has
          previously taken weeks to identify the origin of these epidemics or
          the reason why individuals get unwell.<br /><br />

          Brands may follow a food product's journey from its starting point to
          every stop it takes, all the way to delivery, by using blockchain
          technology. Furthermore, these businesses can now see everything else
          they could have come into touch with, which makes it possible to
          identify issues far earlier and possibly save lives. There are other
          ways that blockchain may be implemented; this is just one example of
          how it's done in practice.
